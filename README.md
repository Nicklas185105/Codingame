## Introduction
In this reposority you will find my working solutions for puzzles on the platform https://www.codingame.com/. In the table below you can see which puzzles I already completed.

> **Info:** It is not my intention to write the solutions as short as possible! I just want to write my code understandable and clean even when it makes the actual code longer.
